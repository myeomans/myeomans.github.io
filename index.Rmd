I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Business School, studying computational social psychology. In my research I apply machine learning in cases where we know human judgment is biased or incomplete. This is true of many social interactions - negotiations, recommendations, first impressions, meetings, even friendly conversations. When we try to understand other people, we often find that our perspective-taking capacity is limited. In these cases, natural language processing can help us understand and improve the decisions we make when we communicate.
