<b>Hello, and welcome to my website! </b>I am currently an Assistant Professor in Strategy and Organisational Behaviour at Imperial College Business School.

<div style="font-size: 20px">
<b>In my research, I use natural language processing to study decision-making in conversation. </b> Almost anywhere you find people on this earth, you will find us talking to one another, in pursuit of all kinds of goals, including: learning, teaching, co-ordination, self-presentation, connection, or even enjoyment. My work shows how conversation technology can help us understand our conversational decisions, and how to make them better.

If you'd like to start a conversation about one of these goals (including research, teaching, speaking, consulting) please find my contact information through the links above and reach out!
