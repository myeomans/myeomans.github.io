In my research, I focus on machine learning applications in behavioral science. In particular, my research primarily focuses on cases where we know human judgment is biased or incomplete. Many of these examples are “interpersonal prediction problems” - domains where we must understand other people’s preferences and intentions to pursue our own social goals. Often we find that our perspective-taking capacity can be limited or biased. But these are examples where machine learning can help to understand and improve on the choices that people make when they navigate complex social interactions.

Currently, I am pursuing this research as a post-doctoral fellow at Massachussetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of Toronto and in 2014, I completed a PhD and an MBA in Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
