I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Business School in the Negotations, Organzations and Markets unit. In 2020, I will be joining the Faculty at Imperial College Buisness School. In my research, I use natural language processing to study decision-making in conversation, to improve what people say to each other.
