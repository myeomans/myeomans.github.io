I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of Toronto and in 2014, I completed a PhD and an MBA in Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 

My research sits at the intersection of this developing sciences of machine learning and behavioral science. In particular, my research primarily applies machine learning to cases where we know human judgment is biased or incomplete. Many of these examples are “interpersonal prediction problems” - domains where we must understand other people’s preferences and intentions to pursue our goals. In these cases, our perspective-taking capacity can be limited, in part because the information available about someone - their words, their actions - are so complex and high-dimensional. My research focuses on examples where machine learning can help to understand the choices that people make in social interactions.
